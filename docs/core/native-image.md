title: GraalVM Native Image
---

Cats Effect 3.3.0 brought support for printing [a fiber dump](./fiber-dumps.md)
to the standard error stream.
This functionality can be triggered using POSIX signals. Unfortunately,
due to the `sun.misc.Signal` API being an unofficial JDK API, in order to
achieve maximum compatibility, this functionality was implemented using the
[`java.lang.reflect.Proxy`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/)
reflective approach.

Luckily, GraalVM Native Image has full support for both `Proxy` and POSIX
signals. Cats Effect jars contain extra metadata that makes building native
images seamless, without the need of extra configuration.
