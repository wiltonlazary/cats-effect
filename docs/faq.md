## Scala CLI

[Scala CLI](https://scala-cli.virtuslab.org/) can run both `.sc` files and `.scala` files. `.sc` files allow definitions at the top level and a main method is synthesized to run it. Unfortunately this does not work well with `IO#unsafeRunSync`. You should put your cats-effect code inside the `run` method of an `IOApp` and save it as a `.scala` file instead.

```scala-cli
//> using scala "2.13.8"
//> using lib "org.typelevel::cats-effect::3.3.12"

import cats.effect._

object HelloWorld extends IOApp.Simple {
  val run: IO[Unit] = IO.println("Hello world")
}
```

```sh
scala-cli Hello.scala
```

## Blocking Behaviour

Prior to the 3.3.2 release, running the following code : -

```scala
  def run: IO[Unit] =
    IO(println(Thread.currentThread.getName)) >>
      IO.blocking(println(Thread.currentThread.getName)) >>
      IO(println(Thread.currentThread.getName))
```

will output the following: -
```
io-compute-4
io-blocking-0
io-compute-4
```

Running the same code on >= 3.3.2 release will output: -

```
io-compute-4
io-compute-4
io-compute-4
```

This is expected behaviour and not a bug. It is related to some optimizations that were introduced in the use of `cats.effect.unsafe.WorkStealingThreadPool`. For full
details, please refer to [this issue comment](https://github.com/typelevel/cats-effect/issues/3005#issuecomment-1134974318).
